function Xing = calc_xing(a,chicrit)

% A small function to calculate the crossings for a profile likelihood in
% <a> with a criterion <chicrit>. This is placed in a function as it is
% used and in <calc_proflik> and in <calc_likregion> (several times in that
% one).
%
% First column in <Xing> is the x-value for the crossing, and the second a
% flag for when the CI is open on the edge (1 instead of a zero in the
% first or last row in <Xing>). Note that a middle column is generated
% below (direction: -1 for a lower bound of the CI, +1 for an upper) but
% this is removed before returning the output.
