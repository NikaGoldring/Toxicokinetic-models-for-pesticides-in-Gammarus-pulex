function [out_c,kc] = read_scen(type,c,t,glo)

% Usage: [out_c,kc] = read_scen(type,c,t,glo)
%
% This function is used to calculate a concentration, previously prepared
% in glo, or remove scenarios when type is -5. The code is copied from
% make_scen, but glo is no longer global. This saves a lot of speed when
% this function is called from derivatives (and to a lesser effect from
% simplefun)! Furthermore, a number of other changes to increase speed.
% When using an ODE solver, derivatives and this function are called MANY
% times, and therefore, small speed increases there make a huge
% differences. The function make_scen still has the same functionality to
% allow for backwards compatibility.
%
% <type> is used to decide what to return to the calling function: 
%     -1) then we are called from derivatives, and return one c
%     -2) we are called from simplefun and need to return a matrix Tev
%     -3) we are called for fast/slow kinetics and need to return a vector c
% <c>    identifier of the treatment
% <t>    time point or time vector to use for the exposure scenario
% <glo>  the structure with information (normally global); used as input
%        increases speed

% We are always called to return an exposure profile (or a single
