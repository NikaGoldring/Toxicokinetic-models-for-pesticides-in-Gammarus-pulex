function [data_out,S0,w_out] = recalc_data(data_in,w_in,lam)

% Usage: [data_out,S0,w_out] = recalc_data(data_in,w_in,lam)
%
% Function to recalculate the data for a SINGLE treatment for plotting. If
% entering replicates, it will combine replicates into a single value with
% CI. The function also deals with NaNs, weights/outliers (sub-lethal
% endpoints) and missing/removed animals (survival).
% 
% For survival, the CI is the Wilson score interval (also used in
% openGUTS). For sub-lethal data, weights are used to calculate a weighted
% mean. The CI on the weighted mean is approximated by two times the SE of
% the weighted mean, as calculated according to Madansky and Alexander
% (following WinCross/Quantum). See:
% http://www.analyticalgroup.com/download/WEIGHTED_MEAN.pdf. For this to
% work properly, weights need to represent the number of observations on
% which a data point is based (i.e., the number of animals in the replicate
% on which a mean is based).
%
% This function is called in plot_tktd and in calc_and_plot. Large parts of
% the code is based on openGUTS prepare_data.

    indnan = isnan(data_in); % remember where the NaNs in the data are
    
    % below, the vector/matrix with missing animals is used (cumulative)
    % for this treatment only. Note that first row in w_ic must be zeros
    S0 = ones(size(data_in,1),1) * data_in(1,:) - cumsum(cat(1,w_in(1,:),w_in(1:end-1,:)),1); % initial number of animals over time, corrected for missing animals
    S0(indnan) = 0; % where the data is NaN, make the number of animals zero
    S0 = sum(S0,2); % total number of animals over all replicates, corrected for NaNs and missing animals
    
    s_ic = sum(data_in,2,'omitnan'); % for survival data, we'll simply sum the survivors, ignoring the NaNs!
    % Without missing animals, this can be used to calculate survival
    % probabilities directly, but even with missing animals this is needed
    % to calculate deaths.
    
    if sum(w_in(:)) == 0 % if there are NO missing animals, things are simple!
        w_in  = sum(w_in,2); % rather superfluous as they are zero anyway
        ps_ic = s_ic ./ S0 ; % vector with survival probabilities
        % Note: where all replicates are NaN, S0 will be zero, so the
        % probability to survive will become NaN again. The Wilson score
        % will also become NaN. When only some replicates are NaN, this
        % works fine: the probability is calculated based on the replicates
        % that ARE there.
    else
        % For missing/removed animals, the calculation is a bit more
        % cumbersome. I initially thought that it was okay to use S0 to
        % calculate the probabilities: if you remove animals, that simply
        % means you started out with less. However, it does not work that
        % way. Perhaps easiest to illustrate with an example. Suppose we
        % have survival data [100;50;10] with 40 animals missing after the
        % second observation. Initial nr of animals is thus for the two
        % intervals 100 and 60. The survival probability would then, with
        % S0, be [1;0.5;0.17], which is incorrect as there is no mortality
        % at all in the second interval. The correct way was already used
        % in DEBtoxM and in BYOM, so I just needed to rediscover it. You
        % need to calculate *conditional* survival probabilities for each
        % interval and multiply them. The implementation is different from
        % previous versions to make it more tractable (and as we keep the
        % NaNs in the data set).
        for i = 1:size(data_in,1) % run through time points
            if any(indnan(i,:)) % if there is at least one NaN on this time point
                data_in(i,indnan(i,:)) = data_in(i-1,indnan(i,:))-w_in(i-1,indnan(i,:));
            end
            % replace NaN in data set by previous observation, minus
            % removed animals there; this assumes that no animals die in
            % the NaN intervals, which is okay as we remove these intervals
            % later anyway. This also works when there are more NaNs in the
            % same column, at consecutive time points (that is why I think
            % this needs a for loop). This is a bit awkward, but is
            % difficult to avoid as there may be a NaN in one or more (or
            % all) replicates at some time point.
