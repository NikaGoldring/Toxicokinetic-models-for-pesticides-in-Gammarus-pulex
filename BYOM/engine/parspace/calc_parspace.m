%
% Optimisation and finding a likelihood-based joint confidence region
% without the need for starting values. However, the parameter space to be
% searched must be limited for the algorithm to be effective. Parameter
% space to be searched is defined as the min-max bounds of the parameters
% in the matrix <pmat>. This is basically a genetic algorithm, whose aim is
% to find the best fitting parameter set and a cloud of points within a
% certain goodness-of-fit criterion (to be used for calculating confidence
% intervals). The algorithm applies likelihood profiling to refine and test
% the cloud from parameter space.
%
% Inputs
% <pmat>        parameter matrix
% <opt_optim>   structure with options for optimisations
% <SETTINGS_OPTIM> = settings read from setup_settings by <calc_optim_ps>
% 
% Outputs
% <minmax>  this is used to restart when slow kinetics is indicated; in
%    that case, it is a matrix with the min/max for each parameter of the
%    cloud that was used for testing slow kinetics. If all goes well,
%    <minmax>=-1 and no restart is made.
% <mll>     minus log-likelihood; this will be the lowest value found in the run
% <stats>   some statistics from the run: vector with number of sets in
%           joint CI, inner rim, and propagation band
% <pmat_print>  matrix with information on each parameter (best value and CI info)
% <pmat>        parameter matrix with best-fit values in first column

% between the min and max bounds (for log-scale parameters, the range is
% thus log-linear).
