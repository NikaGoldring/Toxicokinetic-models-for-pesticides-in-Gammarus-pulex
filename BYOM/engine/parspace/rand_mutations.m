function coll_tries = rand_mutations(pmat,coll_ok,bnds_tmp,n_tr_i,d_grid_i,f,n_rnd)

% Usage: coll_tries = rand_mutations(pmat,coll_ok,bnds_tmp,n_tr_i,d_grid_i,f,n_rnd)
% 
% This function randomly mutates the parameter sets in <coll_ok>, with the
% settings obtained for this round from <calc_parspace>. For each mutated
% set, it calculates the min-log-likelihood (MLL). Mutated sets with their
% MLL are returned in the matrix <coll_tries>.
% 
% The inputs may be organised in a different form. Quite a few inputs are
% needed, and it is only called from <calc_parspace>. However, this part of
% the code is called at two locations in <calc_parspace>, and is therefore
% best placed in a separate function.
% 
% Inputs
% <pmat>     parameter matrix
% <coll_ok>  parameter sets (and their MLL) that need to be mutated to new tries (matrix)
% <bnds_tmp> boundaries of parameter space (log-transformed were needed) (matrix)
% <n_tr_i>   number of new parameter tries per element of <coll_ok>
% <d_grid_i> initial grid spacing for each parameter times the max jump size in this round (vector)
%            Note: the function call in <calc_parspace> produces this entry
%            as <f_d_i*d_grid>.
% <f> and <n_rnd> are only used to update the progress bar
% 
% Outputs
% <coll_tries>  mutated parameter sets with their MLL (matrix)
