% BYOM is a General framework for simulating model systems in terms of
% ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model itself needs to be
% specified in <derivatives.html derivatives.m>, and <call_deri.html
% call_deri.m> may need to be modified to the particular problem as well.
% The files in the engine directory are needed for fitting and plotting.
% Results are shown on screen but also saved to a log file (results.out).
% 
% *The model:* An organism is exposed to a chemical in its surrounding
% medium. The animal accumulates the chemical according to standard
% one-compartment first-order kinetics, specified by a bioconcentration
% factor (_Piw_) and an elimination rate (_ke_). The chemical degrades at a
% certain rate (_kd_). When the external concentration reaches a certain
% concentration (_Ct_), degradation stops. 
%
% *This script:* byom_bioconc_sim is an example of how to use the
% simulator. If you start building a model, simulations are useful to get a
% better idea of what the model can do. By all means also try _plot_option =
% 5_ (plots the derivative versus the state variable). Make sure that the
% ODE version of the model is used (set _useode=1_ in call_deri.m).

%% Initial things
% Make sure that this script is in a directory somewhere *below* the BYOM
% folder.
clear, clear global % clear the workspace and globals
global X0mat        % make scenarios global
global glo          % allow for global parameters in structure glo
diary off           % turn off the diary function (if it is accidentaly on)
% set(0,'DefaultFigureWindowStyle','docked'); % collect all figure into one window with tab controls
set(0,'DefaultFigureWindowStyle','normal'); % separate figure windows

pathdefine % set path to the BYOM/engine directory
glo.basenm = mfilename; % remember the filename for THIS file for the plots

%% Initial values for the state variables
% Initial states, scenarios in columns, states in rows. First row are the
% 'names' of all scenarios.

X0mat = [10 20 30 50    % the scenarios (here nominal concentrations) 
          9 18 27 47    % initial values state 1 (actual external concentrations)
          0  0  0  0];  % initial values state 2 (internal concentrations)
   
%% Initial values for the model parameters
% Model parameters are part of a 'structure' for easy reference. 

% syntax: par.name = [startvalue];
par.kd    = 0.1;  % degradation rate constant, d-1
par.ke    = 0.2;  % elimination rate constant, d-1
par.Piw   = 200;  % bioconcentration factor, L/kg
par.Ct    = 5;    % threshold external concentration where degradation stops, mg/L

%% What to calculate and what to plot
% Specify what to calculate and what to plot.

glo.t = linspace(0,50,100); % time vector for the model curves in days

% specify the y-axis labels for each state variable
glo.ylab{1} = 'external concentration (mg/L)';
glo.ylab{2} = 'internal concentration (mg/kg)';
% specify the x-axis label (same for all states)
glo.xlab    = 'time (days)';
glo.leglab1 = 'Conc. '; % legend label before the 'scenario' number
glo.leglab2 = ' mg/L'; % legend label after the 'scenario' number

% set options for call_deri here (we don't do prelim_checks for simulations)
glo.useode   = 1; % calculate model using ODE solver (1)
glo.eventson = 1; % events function on (1) or off (0)
glo.stiff    = 0; % set to 1 to use a stiff solver instead of the standard one

%% Optional settings
% Also try plottype 5 for this example! See the SIMbyom package for more
% detailed information on the simulator options.
 
opt_sim.plottype = 3; % default: 4
% 1) 3d plot, 
% 2) 2d plot, 
% 3) states in subplots, 
% 4) scenarios in subplots,
% 5) dx/dt versus x
% 6) 2d plot for each scenario separate

%% Calculations and plotting
% Here, the script is called that will do the calculation and the plotting.

sim_and_plot(par,opt_sim); % call the script which calculates and plots
