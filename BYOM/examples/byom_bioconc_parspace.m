% BYOM is a General framework for simulating model systems in terms of
% ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model itself needs to be
% specified in <derivatives.html derivatives.m>, and <call_deri.html
% call_deri.m> may need to be modified to the particular problem as well.
% The files in the engine directory are needed for fitting and plotting.
% Results are shown on screen but also saved to a log file (results.out).
%
% *The model:* An organism is exposed to a chemical in its surrounding
% medium. The animal accumulates the chemical according to standard
% one-compartment first-order kinetics, specified by a bioconcentration
% factor (_Piw_) and an elimination rate (_ke_). The chemical degrades at a
% certain rate (_kd_). When the external concentration reaches a certain
% concentration (_Ct_), degradation stops. This is useful to demonstrate the
% events function in call_deri.m, which catches this discontuity
% graciously. 
%
% *This script:* byom_bioconc_parspace demonstrates the use of the openGUTS
% parameter-space explorer algorithm. The user needs to set search ranges,
% but after that, the algorithm will find the optimum, CIs on model
% parameters, and a sample to be used for CIs on model curves. Note that
% this analysis takes a bit of time to finish (some 15 min.)!

% folder.

%% The data set
% Data are entered in matrix form, time in rows, scenarios (exposure
% concentrations) in columns. First column are the exposure times, first
% row are the concentrations or scenario numbers. The number in the top
% left of the matrix indicates how to calculate the likelihood:
%
% * -1 for multinomial likelihood (for survival data)
% * 0  for log-transform the data, then normal likelihood
% * 0.5 for square-root transform the data, then normal likelihood
% * 1  for no transformation of the data, then normal likelihood

%% Initial values for the state variables
% Initial states, scenarios in columns, states in rows. First row are the
% 'names' of all scenarios.

X0mat = [10 20 30 50    % the scenarios (here nominal concentrations) 
          9 18 27 47    % initial values state 1 (actual external concentrations)
          0  0  0  0];  % initial values state 2 (internal concentrations)

%% Initial values for the model parameters
% Model parameters are part of a 'structure' for easy reference. 

% syntax: par.name = [startvalue fit(0/1) minval maxval optional:log/normal
% scale (0/1)]; Note: when using parspace, the search ranges and the
% log/normal scale flags are very important, and need to be set with care.
% The starting-value in the first column is irrelevant, but needs to be
% within the search range.
par.kd    = [0.1  1 0.01 10   0];  % degradation rate constant, d-1
par.ke    = [0.2  1 0.01 10   0];  % elimination rate constant, d-1
par.Piw   = [200  1 10   1000 0];  % bioconcentration factor, L/kg
par.Ct    = [5    0 0    1e6  1];  % threshold external concentration where degradation stops, mg/L

%% Time vector and labels for plots
% Specify what to plot. If time vector glo.t is not specified, a default is
% constructed, based on the data set.

% specify the y-axis labels for each state variable
glo.ylab{1} = 'external concentration (mg/L)';
glo.ylab{2} = 'internal concentration (mg/kg)';
% specify the x-axis label (same for all states)
glo.xlab    = 'time (days)';
glo.leglab1 = 'conc. '; % legend label before the 'scenario' number
glo.leglab2 = 'mg/L';   % legend label after the 'scenario' number

prelim_checks % script to perform some preliminary checks and set things up
% Note: prelim_checks also fills all the options (opt_...) with defauls, so
% modify options after this call, if needed.

%% Calculations and plotting
% Here, the functions are called that will do the calculation and the
% plotting. 
% 
% Options for the plotting can be set using opt_plot (see prelim_checks.m).
% Options for the optimsation routine can be set using opt_optim. Options
% for the ODE solver are part of the global glo. For the demo, the
% iterations were turned off (opt_optim.it = 0).

opt_optim.type   = 4; % optimisation method 1) simplex, 4) parameter-space explorer
opt_optim.fit    = 1; % fit the parameters (1), or don't (0)
opt_optim.it     = 1; % show iterations of the optimisation (1, default) or not (0)
opt_plot.bw      = 1; % if set to 1, plots in black and white with different plot symbols
opt_plot.annot   = 2; % annotations in multiplot for fits: 1) box with parameter estimates 2) single legend
% opt_plot.statsup = [2]; % vector with states to suppress in plotting fits

opt_optim.ps_plots = 1; % when set to 1, makes intermediate plots to monitor progress of parameter-space explorer
opt_optim.ps_profs = 1; % when set to 1, makes profiles and additional sampling for parameter-space explorer
opt_optim.ps_rough = 1; % set to 1 for rough settings of parameter-space explorer, 0 for settings as in openGUTS
opt_optim.ps_saved = 0; % use saved set for parameter-space explorer (1) or not (0);

% optimise and plot (fitted parameters in par_out)
par_out = calc_optim(par,opt_optim); % start the optimisation
% no plotting here; we'll immediately plot with CIs below

%% Plot results with confidence intervals
% The following code can be used to make a standard plot (the same as for
% the fits), but with confidence intervals. Options for confidence bounds
% on model curves can be set using opt_conf (see prelim_checks).
% 
% Use opt_conf.type to tell calc_conf which sample to use: 
% -1) Skips CIs (zero does the same, and an empty opt_conf as well).
% 1) Bayesian MCMC sample (default); CI on predictions are 95% ranges on 
% the model curves from the sample 
% 2) parameter sets from a joint likelihood region using the shooting 
% method (limited sets can be used), which will yield (asymptotically) 95% 
% CIs on predictions
% 3) as option 2, but using the parameter-space explorer

opt_conf.type    = 3; % make intervals from 1) slice sampler, 2)likelihood region shooting, 3) parspace explorer
opt_conf.lim_set = 2; % use limited set of n_lim points (1) or outer hull (2, likelihood methods only) to create CIs

out_conf = calc_conf(par_out,opt_conf); % calculate confidence intervals on model curves
calc_and_plot(par_out,opt_plot,out_conf); % call the plotting routine again to plot fits with CIs

% Here, we can also use the new plotting function for TKTD models. Even
% though this is not a TKTD model, we can still plot the internal
% concentration, with the treatments in separate panels.
glo.locC       = [1 2]; % tell plot_tktd that our first and second state variable are internal concentrations to plot
opt_tktd.repls = 0; % plot individual replicates (1) or means (0)
opt_tktd.min   = 0; % set to 1 to show a dotted line for the control (lowest) treatment
plot_tktd(par_out,opt_tktd,opt_conf);
