%% BYOM function derivatives.m (the model in ODEs)
%
%  Syntax: dX = derivatives(t,X,par,c,glo)
%
% This function calculates the derivatives for the model system. It is
% linked to the script files <byom_bioconc_extra.html byom_bioconc_extra.m>
% and <byom_bioconc_start.html byom_bioconc_start.m>. As input,
% it gets:
%
% * _t_   is the time point, provided by the ODE solver
% * _X_   is a vector with the previous value of the states
% * _par_ is the parameter structure
% * _c_   is the external concentration (or scenario number)
% * _glo_ is the structure with information (normally global)
% 
% Note: _glo_ is now an input to this function rather than a global. This
% makes the code considerably faster.
%
% Time _t_ and scenario name _c_ are handed over as single numbers by
% <call_deri.html call_deri.m> (you do not have to use them in this
% function). Output _dX_ (as vector) provides the differentials for each
% state at _t_.

%% Start
% Note that, in this example, variable _c_ (the scenario identifier) is not
% used in this function. The treatments differ in their initial exposure
% concentration that is set in X0mat. Also, the structure _glo_ is not used
% here.

function dX = derivatives(t,X,par,c,glo)

%% Unpack states
% The state variables enter this function in the vector _X_. Here, we give
% them a more handy name.
%global glo  
if t< 2.03  %AMD: modify for respective depuration time!
    Cw = c; % AMD: c is the scenario identifyer, here this refers to the external concentration 
else 
    Cw = 0;
end

Ci = X(1); % internal concentration

%% Unpack parameters
% The parameters enter this function in the structure _par_. The names in
% the structure are the same as those defined in the byom script file.
% The 1 between parentheses is needed as each parameter has 5 associated
% values.

ke   = par.ke(1);     % elimination rate constant, d-1
Piw  = par.ku(1)/ke;  % bioconcentration factor, L/kg

% % Optionally, include the threshold concentration as a global (see script)
% Ct   = glo.Ct;      % threshold external concentration that stops degradation, mg/L

%% Calculate the derivatives
% This is the actual model, specified as a system of two ODEs:
%
% $$ \frac{d}{dt}C_w=-k_d C_w \quad \textrm{as long as } C_w>C_t $$
%
% $$ \frac{d}{dt}C_i=k_e(P_{iw}C_w-C_i) $$

dCi = ke * (Piw * Cw - Ci); % first order bioconcentration

dX = [dCi]; % collect derivatives in vector dX
